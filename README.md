### Notes

I have created this project while ago. After talking with Akon it was decided that I would create a new repo and share it with the team.
The basic idea is to completely replace the current Ratel. Because he is insanely complex to maintain. My idea was to start from scratch and simpler. Iâ€™m using zustand instead of Redux and Vite instead of create react app. The goal is to have fewer dependencies compared to the current one and to be able to move quickly and be as light as possible.

If you can contribute feel free.
